# TheCoffeeShop-Analysis
A simple data analysis of sales trends of a coffee shop over three locations. It has a very wide range of products of which some or few perform very well in different seasons.
So,i used some sql to sort through the cobwebs and gained some insights that could be valuable to improve the bottom line. I  just had a comprehensive sales history,maybe if i also had data on the costs to run these stores,the picture would be much clearer.
Nevertheless. I used some Looker Studio and Google Sheets to help bring the visuals to life and hopefully,i did a good job in making the visuals tell a compelling story about the boring numbers but thats for my mentor to judge. I dont know if he'll actually read this.I hope he does.
